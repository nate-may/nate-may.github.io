            <h2>Medium Trail</h2>
            <p>For the almost average mountaineer, we offer our medium-grade trail. The Medium Trail offers a unique biking experience, with several inclines and slopes for the adventure seeker. We recommend an average biking skill-set as this trail requires a great deal more endurance than the Mild Trail. Our mountain guides are able to offer this trail all days that the weather and our business schedule permits. There will not be trails available in the event of severe weather due to insurance purposes. </p>

            <h2>Extreme Trail</h2>
            <p>For those thrill seekers who want a once in a lifetime experience, we offer the Extreme Trail. This trail is only offered with the availability of our senior mountain guides who have emergency first aid training in addition to their mountain guide training. We highly recommend prior experience on high endurance mountain trails. Our Extreme Trail offers thrills and chills as there are two different routes that at at least one point take our bikers off road for views that are not easily accessed. Applicants must sign release waivers for insurance purposes, and it is also required that a 'hiking-pack' is purchased with all essentials. This pack includes protein bars, first aid kits, and water back packs. </p>
